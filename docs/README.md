### Notes

1. `done` and `delete` command can only take in one <task number> at a time.
1. All command keywords (`list`, `todo`, `deadline`, `event`, `done`, `delete`, `find`, `bye`) are case-insensitive.
1. The <task name> parameter of the `todo` command cannot be empty.
1. The <task number> parameter of the `delete` and `done` command cannot be empty.
1. The <task name> and <time> parameter of the `deadline` and `event` command cannot be empty.
1. The <keyword> parameter of the `find` command cannot be empty.
1. The <keyword> parameter of the `find` command is case-insensitive.
1. When finding tasks by a <keyword>, the tasks returned to the found-list have the same <task number> as the ones in the original task list.
1. The application auto saves the task list whenever there is a change of tasks in the task list.
1. The application auto loads the previously saved task list immediately after start-up.
